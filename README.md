# N-Queens
N-Queens Problem Solver visualisation with Pygame

## Introduction
The N-Queens problem is a classic combinatorial puzzle where the goal is to place N chess queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. In other words, no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.

This project provides a Python solution to the N-Queens problem using the backtracking algorithm. The visualization is done using the Pygame library.

## Features
Solves the N-Queens problem for any given N.
Displays the final arrangement of queens on the chessboard.
Allows user input for the initial position of the first queen (optional).
Installation
Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3 recommended).
## Install the required dependencies:
pip install pygame

## Usage
Run the n_queens.py script.
If prompted, enter the row number (1 - 8) for the initial queen position.
The program will display the solution and highlight the queens’ positions.
